# Data structures and Algorithms

Solving Algo problems and documenting the thought process behind every structure.


## Roadmap


- Basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees, etc.)

- Advanced data structures: Heaps, Hash Tables, Tries, Graphs (Directed/Undirected, Weighted/Unweighted), Bloom Filters
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort

- Searching algorithms: linear search, binary search

- Time and Space Complexity analysis

- Recursion and Dynamic Programming

- Greedy algorithms

- Divide and Conquer algorithms

- Backtracking

- Branch and bound

- Randomized algorithms

- Approximation algorithms

- Advanced Topics : Memory Management, Amortized Analysis, Persistent Data Structures, External Sorting, Trie based algorithms
